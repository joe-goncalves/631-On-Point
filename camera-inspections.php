				<h2>Case Report</h2>
				This customer was dealing with clogs that kept coming back, and called us to get the whole story. The customer was surprised to learn that his sanitary line was "Orangeburg pipe"-- made of tar paper. The pipe material had softened with age, and our camera inspection showed where it was squashed. It also showed that the first 30 feet of pipe were still in good condition.
