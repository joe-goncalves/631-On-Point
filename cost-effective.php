		<p><em>"It is not the cost of doing the mark outs, it is the expense of not doing them."</em></p>
		<p>On the private side, one of the most overlooked parts of a job process is the utility mark outs. Many people have told us that they believe the cost of a utility mark out was not justified. However, this opinion is voiced only before an unexpected setback, such as an underground electrical fault. Tens of thousands of dollars’ worth of damage to utilities has occurred in many cases, due to a decision to commence a project without performing a utility mark out.</p>

		<p>For example, in April 2009, a soil testing company on Long Island drilled a hole in the ground prior to construction on a strip mall. One week after the drilling, electrical power to the strip mall went out. The outage caused over $25,000 worth of damage in the strip mall’s grocery store alone, due to spoiled food. After the incident, the power company determined that the problem had occurred on private property—and not in the equipment held on public property. This had not been immediately clear, because a week’s time had passed between the test drilling and the power failure. In addition to the damage done, a lot of money and time were spent investigating the problem. In the end, it was revealed that the test drill had nicked the buried power cable that supplied the whole strip mall. The cable’s protective casing was weakened, eventually exposing and damaging the wire inside, causing the costly outage. The soil testing company was held responsible for $100,000, to cover the cost of fixing the electrical fault, replacing the spoiled food, and to compensate the other stores in the strip malls for their lost revenues.</p>
		<p>Scenarios such as this are completely avoidable. Committing the initial expense of locating underground electrical lines, cesspools, tanks, and wells prior to starting a project can save you a large amount of both time and money. On Point Locating can help you mark out your property, clarifying the way forward, and reducing the risk of unexpected costs and delays.</p>
