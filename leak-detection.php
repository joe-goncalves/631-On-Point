		<p>Leak detection helps pinpoint leakages in existing pipelines and water systems. Leaks can cause severe damage to surrounding structures and, when not corrected properly, can be very costly. By using <span class = "comp-title">On Point Locating’s</span> leak detection services, you can find small leaks before they become big problems</p>
		<p>Leaks are not always easy to spot, especially if they are underground.  <span class = 'comp-title'>On Point Locating's</span> leak detection can pin point leaks in existing pipelines and water systems.</p>

		We utilize three different methods of leak detection to insure accuracy:
		<ol>
			<li><a href="thermal-camera-inspections.php">Infrared Cameras</a> - to visibly detect where the leaks originate from behind walls</li>
			<li>Acoustically - our equipment can electronically pick up the slightest sound so we can pin point where the leak is</li>
			<li>Helium Testing - we pump helium into the line, and any place that helium escapes can be pick up through our scanners</li>
		</ol>

				Since one of <span class = "comp-title">On Point Locating's</span> specialties is utility line locating, we first locate the water main line before performing additional tests.  Since we locate the main line first, we eliminate the guess work on one axis where the leak could be.   We then use the latest technology including an acoustic method with the LD leak detector to pinpoint the exact location of the leak.
