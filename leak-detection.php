		<h4 class='no-top-marg'>Helium Leak Detection</h4>
		When a line is pressurized with helium, the gas escapes through even the smallest leaks and cracks. We can pinpoint where the helium is escaping with sensitive detectors.

    	<h4 class='no-top-marg'>Acoustic Leak Detection</h4>
    	Leaking fluids and gases produce sound waves, but they are often much too faint to hear with your own ears. Our acoustic leak detection equipment amplifies minute leak sounds, and reduces background noise to locate the source.
