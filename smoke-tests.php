<h1>Smoke Tests</h1>
<p>Do you have a foul smell or odor in your house that you are unable to locate? Chances are, this is actually a plumbing problem such sewer gas escaping from the drainage system. This is very bad for your health as this gas contains methane and bacteria.</p>
<p><span class = 'comp-title'>on point locating</span> performs smoke tests to find where smells and odors are coming from. We do this by injecting harmless smoke into the sewer system so you can visibly see where there is a leak in system. Smell comes from invisible gases. We turn these invisible gases into visible smoke to detect where the leak is coming from.</p>
