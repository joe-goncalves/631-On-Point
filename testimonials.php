<h1>On Point Testimonials</h1>
<p>"On Point Locating has worked with our company on a few projects.  Each time the jobs were completed on time and under budget.  The reports were clear and  concise.  From the office to the field their staff was polite, professional, and efficient.  We would absolutely utilize them in the future and refer them out."</p>

<p> "I am working to install a septic system and needed a private mark out service completed. On Point was able to come out and mark out all of the underground utilities the same day I called. The surveyor, Mike, was professional and more than happy to go above and beyond; explaining which utilities ran where and approximately how deep the lines were for excavation. With all future excavation projects we will definitely call OnPoint." </p>
