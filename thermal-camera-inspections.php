						On Point Locating uses infrared thermography technology to assist contractors and homeowners in finding anomalies in buildings, structures, and electrical/mechanical equipment. Infrared imaging can detect thermal patterns representing potential problems, without the need for contact temperature measurements or disassembly. This inexpensive diagnostic tool can be used to noninvasively find defects in building insulation, electrical and mechanical equipment, and more. This also allows for smarter predictive maintenance that anticipates equipment failures, rather than just reacting to them. Special cameras, sensitive to radiated infrared energy, produce photographic images of heat emitted from objects and equipment. These images make patterns of heat across the surface immediately apparent, revealing any hot or cold anomalies. Warm areas are typically represented with red, orange, and yellow, while colder areas show up as green, blue, and purple.

						Temperature is a measurement of how fast the molecules in a given object are moving. Every object is made up of moving molecules, and every object has a temperature. Warmer materials, such as hot water, will have particles that move more rapidly than colder materials, such as an ice cube. As an objectâ€™s surface temperature increases, so does the amount of heat energy it radiates. This change in emitted energy, viewed through an infrared camera, can yield information about equipment load, bearing life, insulation condition, fluid and steam leaks, and more. Once On Point Locating has found a potential defect, it is ready to be repaired by the homeowner or contractor.
