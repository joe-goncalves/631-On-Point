				<p>Electrical component failures can be both costly and dangerous. Overheated electrical components can cause serious damage to the electrical systems or surrounding equipment. Failure to properly maintain electrical components can result in costly repairs. The cost is even greater if you consider profits lost to down time and decreased productivity. Overheated electrical components are also a fire hazard. Neglecting to fix damaged components can be a huge safety risk.</p>
				<p>Infrared imaging can detect overheated electrical components, so they can be repaired before expensive or dangerous damage occurs. Infrared imaging should be done regularly on all electrical components for predictive and preventative maintenance, whether or not you are concerned about the functionality of the electrical components.</p>

						Overheating due to increased resistance is a common cause of electrical component failure. Even though increased resistance can occur naturally over time, due to degradation and oxidation in old electrical components, excessive resistance can also be found in newer electrical components due to loose connections or improper installation. It is important to remember that even new electrical components can overheat and fail.
