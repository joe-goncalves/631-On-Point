<h2>Energy Loss </h2>
<p><img src="/images/thermal-building.png" class="left-photo" alt="a building using thermal imaging"/>Properly installed insulation, in good condition, resists the flow of heat. This increases the effectiveness of building heating in the winter, and cooling in the summer. Insulation in good condition presents a relatively uniform thermal pattern, with no large temperature differences. An anomaly such as a warm or cold spot can indicate insulation that is in poor condition, improperly installed, or missing entirely. This allows hot or cold air to escape from the building, and usually results in a very costly loss of energy.</p>
<p>For example, a well-maintained roof of a house will present a uniform temperature pattern in an infrared image. For example, on a cold day, the whole roof will show up on the cold end of the spectrum, even though the interior of the home is being heated. If an inspection is done in the winter, and your roof shows strong hot spots, the heat that you pay for is escaping your home.</p>
<p>Energy loss is frequently caused by insulation that is degraded, improperly installed, or saturated with water. Repairing or replacing insulation can help you use energy more efficiently, saving you money in the long run. Infrared thermography by On Point Locating can help to focus your repair efforts where they are needed most.</p>
