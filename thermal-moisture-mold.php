<p>Water can enter a building’s interior through cracks in the building exterior, or through leaky pipes. Even minute amounts of water can settle in the walls, flooring, or roofing and cause damage. Trapped moisture, when left untreated, allows for the growth of mold, formation of rot in wooden components of a building, and rust and corrosion of metal components. If treated early, repair costs can be minimized. However, when left untreated, the damage worsens over time—requiring a much more extensive and costly repair.</p>
<p>Infrared imaging can be used for detecting trapped moisture in walls and roofs of buildings. Moisture and mold tend to accumulate over time, eventually to the point where they can compromise the integrity of a building. Removal of large amounts of mold, and its associated repairs, are very costly when the problem has been allowed to persist. More severe mold problems can also pose a health hazard, which is the last thing you want in the place you live or work.</p>
<p>By doing routine infrared imaging on a building, undesired moisture can be detected early, before it has caused the larger problems of structural damage, or growth and spread of mold. Early detection is key to minimizing maintenance costs.</p>
