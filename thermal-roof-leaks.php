				<p>The roof of a building protects against the damaging elements of nature, including weather, wind, and the heat and UV radiation of the Sun. The roof is expected to seal out water, but many roofs have passages like chimneys or vents that must be allowed to pass through. It is around these passages, or at the edges, that a roof is most likely to develop leaks, accumulation of water, and other damage. Trapped moisture from rain can cause rot in roofing tiles. The continued stress of the Sun’s heat, and the other elements of nature, tend to exacerbate the problem of trapped water. When left untreated, even the most minor damage to a roof can quickly turn into a safety hazard. Insulation that has become saturated with water is also much less effective at resisting the flow of heat, and maintaining the climate control that you pay for.</p>
				<p>When the Sun beats down on top of a roof, the roof is receiving the Sun’s radiated energy, and it heats up. At night, the roof is no longer receiving this energy and it cools down. Areas of trapped water in the roof, however, cool down more slowly. This additional warmth accelerates the already harmful reactions that the trapped moisture creates—like rot, rust, and mold. An infrared inspection of the roof conducted after sundown will point out where the roof is still warm from retained moisture, allowing you to perform repairs before the presence of moisture has progressed to cause more serious problems.</p>
				<p>The roof is one of the most important safety features in your home. This is why roofs undergo strict inspection during home sales. Collapsed roofing can cause damage to a home’s interior, and personal property of the occupants. This is not to mention the potential for personal injury in the case of a collapse. This is why it is important to have an infrared inspection performed on your home’s roof on a regular basis, as well as prior to a sale. It is also especially important to inspect the roof for integrity before installing any equipment that may add extra weight to the roof, such as satellite dishes or solar panels.</p>
